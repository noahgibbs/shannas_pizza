========= Pizza TODO:

When an invalid key or mouse button is hit, flash the screen or respond
in some way.  Provide an option to turn this off, perhaps (or not).

Add splitters (nodes, in Robot Odyssey parlance)

Figure out how to draw wires better

Wires slowly (or quickly?) change color?

==== Eventual

Make program full-screen, with coordinates recentered somehow

Merge inputs with outputs into a single connection structure.

Add "continue propagating" flag to use with _process() function

========= XYZ TODO:

Animations and variables

==== Eventual

Allow Z-reordering of sprites

Return value for more event handlers, for cancelling events

Error handling APIs

Autoupdater
  * Make sure only to update if no error
  * Save previous copy as backup?
  * Send version # to web service and/or check known URL to find download
  * Unpack before deleting files, and keep certain known filenames
    (license files, maybe libraries, unchanged files?)
