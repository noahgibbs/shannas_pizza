When an invalid key or mouse button is hit, flash the screen or respond
in some way.  Provide an option to turn this off, perhaps (or not).

Make program full-screen, with coordinates recentered somehow

Merge inputs with outputs into a single connection structure.

Add splitters (nodes, in Robot Odyssey parlance)

Error handling APIs

Autoupdater
  * Make sure only to update if no error
  * Save previous copy as backup?
  * Send version # to web service and/or check known URL to find download
  * Unpack before deleting files, and keep certain known filenames
    (license files, maybe libraries, unchanged files?)
